This code package includes the following files:

Code Files:
- Model.m (the code that loads in an image and returns a saliency map)
- focusandcenter.m (generates both focus map and centre map, and outputs a combined map)
- ict.m (Integer Cosine transforms an 8x8 image block)
- zigzagscan.m (converts 8x8 block to a one dimension vector with low frequencies preceding the high frequencies)
- peakdet.m (determines the peaks of the zig-zag scanned frequency coefficient amplitude pattern)
- facedetection.m (returns a face map, with face regions marked with Gaussian blobs)
- Overlay.m (returns a saliency map by overlaying face map on combined [focus & centre] map)

Folders:
- Face pics is a directory which contains sample images with faces and their corresponding in-focus visual saliency maps.

Images:
- Sample test images (exampleImage_1.jpg, exampleImage_2.jpg, exampleImage_3.jpeg, exampleImage_4.jpeg, exampleImage_5.jpeg) are provided in the current directory for testing the model.
- exampleImage_1_saliencyMap.bmp is a sample visual saliency map generated by the proposed model for test image 'exampleImage_1.jpg'.

------------------
Extra Installation
------------------
To get the code for model to work, install Matlab's(R 2013b) Computer vision toolbox.

---------------
Getting Started
---------------

After installing the necessary toolbox, open matlab and run:

Model('exampleImage_3.jpeg');
